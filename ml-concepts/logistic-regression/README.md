## Introduction

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification. This implementation demonstrates how to use logistic regression to predict whether an employee will leave the company based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this implementation is assumed to be in the format of `Employee.csv`, containing various attributes related to employees, including education level, gender, and whether they have ever been benched. The target variable is `LeaveOrNot`, indicating if the employee left the company.

### Data Preprocessing
- Categorical variables are encoded (e.g., `Education`, `Gender`, `EverBenched`).
- The dataset is split into features and the target variable.
- Data is split into training and testing sets.
- Features are scaled using StandardScaler.

## Requirements

To run the code in this directory, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rprakashdass/HandsOnML.git
   cd ml-concepts/logistic_regression
   ```

2. **Prepare your dataset**: Ensure you have the `Employee.csv` dataset in the specified path within the code.

3. **Run the Logistic Regression implementation**:
   ```bash
   python logistic_regression.py
   ```

## Usage

The main script (`logistic_regression.py`) contains the complete implementation of the logistic regression model, including:
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Training the logistic regression classifier
- Evaluating the model's accuracy
- Predicting the outcome for a single instance

### Example Output
Upon running the code, you will see printed output for:
- The accuracy score of the model
- The confusion matrix
- The prediction for a single instance

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics are calculated to assess model performance:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions among the total predictions.
